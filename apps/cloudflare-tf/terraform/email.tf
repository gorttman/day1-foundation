# Fastmail migration (2026-08), MX-only setup - keeping Cloudflare as the
# authoritative DNS host, not delegating nameservers to Fastmail. Full NS
# delegation was Fastmail's default-offered path but would break every
# tunneled_hostnames entry in tunnel.tf - Cloudflare has to stay
# authoritative for the zone for the Tunnel to keep working at all.
#
# Deliberately NOT touching MX here. Current live MX (confirmed via public
# DNS, not guessed) is Google Workspace's aspmx.l.google.com (10) /
# alt1.aspmx.l.google.com (20) - switching to Fastmail's in1-smtp/in2-smtp
# is the actual point-of-no-return cutover step and goes in on its own,
# once mail import + parallel testing (see day2-services migration plan)
# is done. This file only adds records that are safe to have live before
# that: DKIM (unused until Fastmail is actually sending, harmless either
# way) and SPF/DMARC in monitor-safe form.

# while Workspace keeps sending would make Workspace's own mail look
# worse than having no SPF record at all. Drop the google include once
