# Import blocks removed (2026-08-10): unifi_user has no documented
# `terraform import` support at all (unlike network/wlan/setting_ips) -
# confirmed via dry-run, every import ID here failed with "cannot
# import non-existent remote object", initially misread as 35 stale
# client records. The real explanation: the provider's `allow_existing`
# attribute (default true) exists specifically so this resource can
# adopt an already-connected client by MAC match at apply time, without
# an import block at all. Dry-run with the import blocks removed shows
# a clean plan (35 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy) and no errors.
#
# Scope note (2026-08-04, HISTORY.md #11, corrected 2026-08-05 - see
# #14 and #16): recently-active clients (last_seen within 30 days) =
# 39, matches what the UniFi UI actually shows. Of those, 25 already
# have a real `name` set live and 18 already have a real
# `dev_id_override` (icon) set live - captured here as existing state,
# same as the original 6. This is NOT the "pick names/icons for every
# client" task - it's "stop leaving already-set real data undrafted."
# The remaining ~14 clients with genuinely nothing set (no name, no
# icon, no fixed_ip) still need the user's input before anything can
# be drafted for them - that part is unchanged.
#
# fixed_ip: NONE of the 20 clients added in #16 need it declared -
# every one either never had a fixed_ip at all, or has one with
# use_fixedip: false (stored but inactive, same "disabled ≠ unset"
# lesson as network.tf/#8). Only the original 6 (HISTORY.md #13) have
# a genuinely ACTIVE reservation.
#
# k8smaster-m/pinode-m: same reasoning as valinor-m in #13 for why
# fixed_ip stays undeclared (their addresses come from static
# NetworkManager config, not a UniFi reservation) - but unlike #13,
# these two DO have a real name + dev_id_override set live, so they
# get a resource now, just without fixed_ip. network_id is
# Cluster-Backend for these two specifically (last_connection_network_id
# confirms it), Default for everyone else.
#
# local_dns_record: none of the 20 new clients have one set live
# (local_dns_record_enabled: false, local_dns_record: "" where the
# field is present at all) - correctly omitted throughout, unlike 5 of
# the original 6.
#
# blocked = false declared explicitly on every new resource - no
# documented default for this attribute (same "don't assume, declare"
# lesson as network.tf/wlan.tf), live value confirmed false/absent for
# all of these.
#
# NOT drafted, no live name at all (name is REQUIRED, not inventing
# one): mac 00:08:9b:bb:ee:d9 (fixed_ip 192.168.2.30, from #13),
# mac 38:a5:c9:e9:91:58 (fixed_ip 192.168.2.29, from #13),
# mac a2:0a:48:a7:dc:3d (has dev_id_override 4511 but no name at all).
#
# user_group_id omitted for all - live usergroup_id is empty string
# (no override) throughout.
#
# Also found, not carried forward here: k8smaster has a "fixed AP" pin
# defined but disabled (fixed_ap_mac -> In-Wall-Office,
# fixed_ap_enabled: false) - not in the unifi_user schema fetched for
# this file, worth checking again if a "pin a client to its nearest AP"
# approach to the roaming problem is ever revisited.
